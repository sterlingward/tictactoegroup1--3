Mission #4 Assignment
IS 413 - Hilton
For this assignment, you will work in your teams to write a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in C#.
The program will be written in two classes:
1) The “Driver” class (the Program.cs class with the main method where the program begins)
will:
• Welcome the user to the game
• Create a game board array to store the players’ choices
• Ask each player in turn for their choice and update the game board array
• Print the board by calling the method in the supporting class
• Check for a winner by calling the method in the supporting class, and notify the players
when a win has occurred and which player won the game
2) The supporting class (with whichever name you choose) will:
• Receive the “board” array from the driver class
• Contain a method that prints the board based on the information passed to it
• Contain a method that receives the game board array as input and returns if there is a
winner and who it was
Each team will divide itself into half, and one half of the team will work on the driver class,
while the other half of the team will work on the supporting class. Each half of the team will use
the Paired Programming approach, where programmers work together on the class to solve the
problem. The Driver (the individual at the keyboard) will type, while the Navigator (the other
team member) will help provide overall direction and watch for any potential errors. You can
switch those roles at any time, but both individuals should be working on their part of the
program together.
